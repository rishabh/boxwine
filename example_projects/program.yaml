# run:

#   - $WINEPREFIX/in/wine/some-file.exe           # Use $WINEPREFIX to access the C:/ in wineprefix
#   - ["on/host/other-file.exe", "--some-arg"]    # use a list to specify arguments that you want to pass in

# the program to start when you run the app, required.
# - can be a path to the program in the form of a string
